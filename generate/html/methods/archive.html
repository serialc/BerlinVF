        <h2>Archival methods</h2>
        <p>
Archives provide a variety of historical evidence (e.g. images, documents, audio) that can be used to gain insight into and an understanding of past geographies. Tempelhof Airport has a long and interesting history. With the airport closure in 2008, the operating institution â€“ the Berlin Airport Association (Berliner Flughafengesellschaft) left an archive documenting the building history starting in 1924 until its closure in 2008 including the development of the building, the Nazi era (1933-1945) and the period during American occupation (1945-1993) and remaining years. Documents are successively being restored and digitized. The archives are located in the Eastern wing of the airport building and are open to visitors by appointment to conduct archival research.
