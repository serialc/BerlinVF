The Tempelhof airport building is one of the few buildings constructed during the Nazi regime in Berlin.
The design is monumental not only by its sheer size (Fig. 1 and 2).
The complex was one of the world’s largest buildings at the time of construction including the 1230m long arch of the hangar (Fig. 1c, 3 and 4).
The airport was the first to divide passenger flows in departure and arrival traffic.
The central check-in area (Fig. 1b, Fig. 5) is flanked by two wings containing offices (Fig. 1a).
The building was not only monumental but also modern using a state-of-the art reinforced steel skeleton which is covered by different stones including marble in the inside (e.g. Fig 6).
Construction of the building was never finished and many sections inside reveal unfinished parts from staircases to ceilings.
This also includes a planned terrace on top of the airport roof which where tens of thousands of people were supposed to gather as part of the NS regime’s showcase of power.
