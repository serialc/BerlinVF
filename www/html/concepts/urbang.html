        Urban gardening in the form of community gardens and allotments provides an entry point to analyze growing concerns and skills around good growing, as spaces of resistance and temporary land uses, political opposition to capitalist and global food chains and a way to re-imagine the city as being a place of food production (e.g., Rosol, 2010). But urban gardening has also been analyzed in terms of its ability to build community and provide spaces of participation and inclusion.
