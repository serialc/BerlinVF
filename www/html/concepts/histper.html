        Tempelhof Airport has a long history, the 1920's airport building built during the NS-regime. The airport is probably most famously known for the airlift (or Berlin Air Bridge) during the blockade of the Soviet Union which cut off West Berlin from June 1948 to May 1949. During that time, supplies for the West Berlin population was exclusively flown into Tempelhof Airport.

            </li>
            <li>
                How i.e. in what form (e.g. original buildings, monuments, documentation) is the past preserved?
            </li>
            <li>
                Are there processes of commodification?
            </li>
            <li>
                How does the past shape the present face of the city?
            </li>
            <li>
                What image of the city is being presented?
