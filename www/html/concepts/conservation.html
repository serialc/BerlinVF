        Rewilding has emerged in recent years as an approach for creative conservation, restoration and reintroduction of species (esp. megafauna). The central aim is to work with nature to restore functions such as predation, flood storage and soil stabilization. The Tempelhof Field contains conservations areas for biodiversity. Some central questions that emerge around concepts of rewilding are linked to the question of what is being restored or conserved and how. This directly links to our understanding of ‘nature’ and ‘culture’. Nature is often perceived as free of humans while culture is considered the opposite.
