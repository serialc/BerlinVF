        <p>
        Tempelhof Field has three main areas in proximity of the three entrances designated to experimental use and pilot projects described as pioneer projects or fields. These are available for citizen-led projects focused on social and ecological benefits.
        </p>

        <p>
The format of the pioneer projects came out of the consultation process and idea workshops held during 2007 and 2009 concerning the use of the Tempelhof Field.
They are based on the idea of participatory and process-oriented land uses.
First established in 2011, the format allows community oriented and common good initiatives and individuals to submit project proposals each year.
Besides foregrounding communal or civil society rather than economic benefits, projects should primarily be based on voluntary contributions, ensure transparency and inclusivity and follow democratic principles.
Proposals are evaluated by a committee.
Projects can range from 1 to 5 years.
Shorter initiatives or one-time events can be submitted through a separate event category.

        <h3>The Nature Experience Space</h3>
        <p>
        The Nature Experience Space located at the Northeast side of the field offers a near-nature play area for children. The site was first developed in 2010 as part of a collaboration between an elementary school and NGO and has been further developed by the state-owned company Grün Berlin in 2022.
