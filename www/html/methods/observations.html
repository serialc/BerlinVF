        Field <strong>observations</strong> are a central form of data collection. They do not only include a description of a location or area but also people, their interactions and processes happening during the observed time span. Central questions from a geographic perspective related to how space is being used and by whom. Questions may include the following:
        <ul>
            <li>What (different) land uses are present?</li>
            <li>Who is using the location under observation?</li>
            <li>How is it being used?</li>
            <li>Who and what is included?</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
        Observations should be recorded in the form of descriptions and/or photographs and videos than can provide helpful ways to illustrate specific points. Observations should be differentiated from interpretations. For example, we can describe people and what they are doing. Based on our observations we may conclude that the observed people are likely to be tourists because they do not speak the local language and take photographs. This, then, is our interpretation and should be recorded as such as it is not a confirmed fact unless confirmed by the group.

        <h3>Ethnographic methods</h3>
        <p>
        Ethnographic methods describe in-depth investigations which often are conducted over longer time periods. The aim is to gain deeper understanding of specific cultural and historical contexts to better understand the actors involved. To do so, researchers may immerse themselves in the local culture and choose to live the community to gain better insights. In the context of the Tempelhofer Field, you may spend the whole day or several days taking part in different activities and interactions, such as volunteering your time at the Allmende Kontor, the urban gardening project.

        <h3>Counts and estimates</h3>
        <p>
        Counts and estimates can be integrated into observation methods to collect data for analysis, such as how many different kinds of maps include information related to public toiletries, how many people access the Tempelhof Field, how many cyclists there are during a period of time, or how many people are there with children or pets. These observations can be mapped or analyzed in different ways to consider a variety of urban geography debates.
