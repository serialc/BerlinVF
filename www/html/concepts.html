        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
        There are many different questions and perspectives you can use to guide your fieldtrip and field work around Tempelhof Airport. You might be interested in land use and decision-making processes, in the history of the site, the way bottom-up, alternative and sharing concepts seek to provide inclusive spaces or the role of rewilding. Concepts provide you with a specific lens to bring into focus dimensions relevant to your research.
