        <h3>A brief history of Berlin Tempelhof Airport</h3>
        <p>
        Tempelhof Airport as a site was first mentioned in official documents in the 1350s referred to as Tempelhof Field. It has a long history of aviation and military uses starting in the 1720s and ended in 2008 with the closure of Tempelhof Airport. Since 2010 the field is open to the public being one of the largest inner urban parks in Europe.

        <p>
        Berlin has a large number of urban gardening projects which are established on undeveloped or temporarily available lots. Some are focused on urban agriculture and food production while others are more focused on providing communal spaces for interaction.

        <h3>Current landuse</h3>
        <p>
        The area of the former Airport Tempelhof can be divided into two different parts. The larger part contains the Tempelhof Field as open urban greenspace (see land use map below). The area of the former airport building at the Southwest edge of the field together with the hangars is not part of the public space. The building, managed by the Tempelhof Projekt GmbH, provides office space, room for exhibitions and events including communal uses.

        <p>
        The transfer of the landuse from airfield to its current and constantly changing landuses was not without contestation, nor is it the end.
